# Fashion-Product-Recommendation
This project contains a Fashion Product Recommendation system using a CNN model in Python. 
It leverages 44,000 fashion images to extract features using the pre-trained ResNet50 model. These features are then used with the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find and recommend similar images based on Euclidean distance.
