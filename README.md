# Fashion-Product-Recommendation
This project contains a Fashion Product Recommendation system using a CNN model in Python. 
It leverages 44,000 fashion images to extract features using the pre-trained ResNet50 model. These features are then used with the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find and recommend similar images based on Euclidean distance. 
The project is structured with scripts for feature extraction (feature_extraction.py), finding similar images (nearest_neighbors.py), utility functions (utils.py), and a main script (main.py). Dependencies include TensorFlow/Keras and Scikit-learn.
